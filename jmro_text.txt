Subject: Information About Last Yearâ€™s Sales

Dear Anthony,

Hello and welcome to the team! I want to tell you about what happened with our sales last year.

Good things:

We spent 6,000 euros on advertising. This helped us get new customers.
We did well in countries like Japan and South Korea. These places are very competitive, so this is good news.
Challenges:

We had some problems in Europe. Our sales targets (goals) were not reached in this region.
Some customers did not buy our new product as soon as we hoped.
Reasons to be happy:

We made new partnerships with businesses in Europe. This can help us grow our sales this year.
In the first six months of this year, our sales in Europe are already getting better.
Plans for the future:

We want to hire more salespeople in Europe. They can help us sell more new products.
We will focus on making our sales in Europe even better.
If you have any questions, please ask me. I am happy to help. I am excited to work with you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
